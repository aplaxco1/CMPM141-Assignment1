        But in the cosmos there is balm as well as bitterness, and that balm is <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">nepenthe</span>. In the supreme 
        horror of that second I <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">forgot what had horrified me</span>, and the burst of <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">black memory vanished</span> in a <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">chaos 
        of echoing images</span>. In a dream I fled from that <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">haunted and accursed pile</span>, and ran swiftly and silently in the 
        <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">moonlight</span>. When I returned to the churchyard place of marble and went <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">down the steps</span> I found the stone trap-door 
        immovable; but I was not sorry, for <a href="page1.html">I had hated the antique castle and the trees</a>. Now I ride with the 
        <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">mocking and friendly ghouls</span> on the night-wind, and play by day amongst the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">catacombs of Nephren-Ka</span> in the sealed 
        and <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">unknown valley of Hadoth by the Nile</span>. I know that light is not for me, save that of the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">moon over the rock 
        tombs of Neb</span>, nor any gaiety save the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">unnamed feasts of Nitokris</span> beneath the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">Great Pyramid</span>; yet in my new wildness 
        and freedom I almost welcome the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">bitterness of alienage</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For although <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">nepenthe</span> has calmed me, I know always that I am an <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">outsider</span>; a <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">stranger in this century</span> and among 
        those who are still men. This I have known ever since I <a href="page6.html">stretched out my fingers to the abomination</a> 
        within that great gilded frame; <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">stretched out my fingers</span> and <a href="page2.html">touched a cold and unyielding surface of <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">polished glass</span></a>.

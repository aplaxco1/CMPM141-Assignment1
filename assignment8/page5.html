        Over two hours must have passed before I reached what seemed to be my goal, a <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">venerable ivied castle</span> in a 
        thickly wooded park, <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">maddeningly familiar</span>, yet full of <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">perplexing strangeness</span> to me. I saw that the moat was 
        filled in, and that some of the well-known towers were <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">demolished</span>, whilst new wings existed to confuse the beholder. 
        But what I observed with chief interest and delight were the open windowsâ€”gorgeously <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">ablaze with light</span> and sending forth 
        sound of the gayest revelry. Advancing to one of these I looked in and saw an <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">oddly dressed company</span> indeed; making merry, 
        and speaking brightly to one another. I had <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">never, seemingly, heard <a href="page2.html">human speech</a></span> before and could guess only 
        vaguely what was said. Some of the faces seemed to hold expressions that brought up <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">incredibly remote recollections</span>, 
        others were <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">utterly alien</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I now stepped through the low window into the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">brilliantly lighted room</span>, stepping as I did so from my single bright 
        moment of hope to my <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">blackest convulsion of despair and realization</span>. The <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">nightmare</span> was quick to come, for as I entered, 
        there occurred immediately one of the most terrifying demonstrations I had ever conceived. Scarcely had I crossed the sill 
        when there descended upon the whole company a sudden and unheralded fear of <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">hideous intensity</span>, distorting every face and 
        evoking the most <a href="page6.html">horrible screams</a> from nearly every throat. Flight was universal, and in the clamour and panic 
        several fell in a swoon and were dragged away by their <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">madly fleeing companions</span>. Many covered their <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">eyes</span> with their <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">hands</span>, 
        and plunged blindly and awkwardly in their race to escape, <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">overturning furniture</span> and <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">stumbling against the walls</span> before they 
        managed to reach one of the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">many doors</span>.

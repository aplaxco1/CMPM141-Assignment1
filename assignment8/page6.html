    <p>
        The <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">cries</span> were shocking; and as I stood in the brilliant apartment <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">alone and dazed</span>, listening to 
        their <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">vanishing echoes</span>, I trembled at the thought of what might be <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">lurking near me unseen</span>. At a casual 
        inspection the room seemed <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">deserted</span>, but when I moved towards one of the alcoves I thought I detected 
        a <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">presence</span> there—<span id="shaky" class="shakeText">a hint of motion beyond the golden-arched doorway</span> leading to another and somewhat 
        similar room. As I approached the arch I began to perceive the presence more clearly; and then, with the 
        first and last sound I ever uttered—<span id="shaky" class="shakeText">a ghastly ululation</span> that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious 
        cause—I beheld in full, <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">frightful vividness the inconceivable</span>, indescribable, and <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">unmentionable monstrosity</span> which 
        had by its simple appearance changed a merry company to a herd of <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">delirious fugitives</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I cannot even hint what it was like, for it was a compound of all that is <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">unclean</span>, <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">uncanny</span>, <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">unwelcome</span>, <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">abnormal</span>, 
        and <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">detestable</span>. It was the ghoulish shade of <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">decay, antiquity, and dissolution</span>; the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">putrid, dripping eidolon of 
        unwholesome revelation</span>, the awful baring of that which the merciful earth should always hide. God knows it was <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">not of 
        this world</span>—or no longer of this world—yet to my horror I saw in its <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">eaten-away</span> and <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">bone-revealing</span> outlines a leering, 
        <span id="shaky" class="shakeText"><a href="page2.html">abhorrent travesty on the human shape</a></span>; and in its </p><span id="shaky" class="shakeText">mouldy, disintegrating apparel</span> an unspeakable quality that 
        chilled me even more.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was almost <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">paralysed</span>, but not too much so to make a feeble effort towards flight; a backward stumble which <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">failed to 
        break the spell</span> in which the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">nameless, voiceless monster</span> held me. My eyes bewitched by the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">glassy orbs</span> which stared loathsomely 
        into them, refused to close; though they were <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">mercifully blurred</span>, and showed the terrible object but indistinctly after the 
        first shock. I tried to raise my hand to <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">shut out the sight</span>, yet so stunned were my nerves that my arm could not fully 
        <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">obey my will</span>. The attempt, however, was enough to disturb my balance; so that I had to <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">stagger forward</span> several steps to avoid 
        falling. As I did so I became suddenly and agonizingly aware of the nearness of the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">carrion thing</span>, whose hideous <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">hollow breathing</span> 
        I half fancied I could hear. <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">Nearly mad</span>, I found myself yet able to throw out a hand to ward off the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">foetid apparition</span> which 
        pressed so close; when in one cataclysmic second of <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">cosmic nightmarishness</span> and <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">hellish accident</span> <span id="shaky" class="shakeText"><i><a href="page7.html">my fingers touched the rotting 
        outstretched paw</a> of the monster beneath the golden arch</i></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I did not shriek, but all the fiendish ghouls that ride the nightwind <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">shrieked for me</span> as in that same second there crashed 
        down upon my mind a single fleeting avalanche of <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">soul-annihilating memory</span>. I knew in that second all that had been; I remembered 
        <a href="page5.html">beyond the frightful castle and the trees</a>, and recognized the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">altered edifice</span> in which I now stood; I recognized, most 
        terrible of all, <span id="shaky" class="shakeText"><a href="page7.html">the unholy abomination</a></span> that stood leering before me as I <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">withdrew my sullied fingers from its own</span>.

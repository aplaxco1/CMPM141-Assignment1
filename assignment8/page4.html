    <p>
        So through <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">endless twilights</span> I dreamed and waited, though I knew not what I waited for. 
        Then in the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">shadowy solitude</span> my <a href="page3.html">longing for light</a> grew so frantic that <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">I could rest no more</span>, 
        and I lifted entreating hands to the single <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">black ruined tower</span> that reached above the forest 
        into the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">unknown outer sky</span>. And at last I resolved to scale that tower, <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">fall</span> though I might; since 
        it were <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">better to glimpse the sky and perish</span>, than to <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">live without ever beholding day</span>.
    </p>
    <p>    
        In the dank twilight I climbed the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">worn and aged stone stairs</span> till I reached the level where they ceased, 
        and thereafter clung perilously to small footholds leading upward. Ghastly and terrible was that <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">dead, 
        stairless cylinder of rock</span>; black, ruined, and deserted, and sinister with startled bats whose <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">wings made no noise</span>. 
        But more ghastly and terrible still was the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">slowness</span> of my progress; for climb as I might, the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">darkness overhead</span> grew 
        no thinner, and a new chill as of <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">haunted and venerable mould</span> assailed me. I shivered as I wondered why I did not reach the 
        light, and would have looked down had I dared. I fancied that night had come suddenly upon me, and vainly groped with one free 
        hand for a window embrasure, that I might peer out and above, and try to judge the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">height</span> I had once attained.
    </p>
    <p>
        All at once, after an infinity of awesome, sightless, crawling up that <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">concave and desperate precipice</span>, I felt my 
        head touch a solid thing, and I knew I must have gained the roof, or at least some kind of floor. In the darkness 
        I raised my free hand and tested the barrier, finding it <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">stone and immovable</span>. Then came a deadly circuit of the 
        tower, clinging to whatever holds the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">slimy wall</span> could give; till finally my testing hand found the barrier 
        yielding, and I turned upward again, pushing the slab or door with my head as I used both hands in my <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">fearful ascent</span>. 
        There was <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">no light</span> revealed above, and as my hands went higher I knew that my climb was for the nonce ended; since 
        the slab was the trapdoor of an aperture leading to a level stone surface of greater circumference than the lower tower, 
        no doubt the floor of some <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">lofty and capacious observation chamber</span>. I crawled through carefully, and tried to prevent the 
        heavy slab from falling back into place, but <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">failed</span> in the latter attempt. As I lay <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">exhausted on the stone floor</span> I heard 
        the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">eerie echoes of its fall</span>, hoped when necessary to pry it up again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Believing I was now at prodigious height, far above the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">accursed branches of the wood</span>, I dragged myself up from the floor 
        and <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">fumbled about</span> for windows, that I might look for the first time upon the sky, and <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">the moon and stars of which I had read</span>. 
        But on every hand I was disappointed; since all that I found were vast shelves of marble, bearing <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">odious oblong boxes of 
        disturbing size</span>. More and more I reflected, and wondered what hoary secrets might abide in this high apartment so many aeons 
        <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">cut off from <a href="page2.html">the castle below</a></span>. Then unexpectedly my hands came upon a doorway, where hung a <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">portal of stone</span>, rough with strange chiselling. 
        Trying it, I found it locked; but with a supreme burst of strength I overcame all obstacles and dragged it open inward. As I did so 
        there came to me the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">purest ecstasy I have ever known</span>; for shining tranquilly through an ornate <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">grating of iron</span>, and down a short stone 
        passageway of steps that ascended from the newly found doorway, was the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">radiant full moon</span>, which I had never before seen save in dreams 
        and in <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">vague visions I dared not call memories</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fancying now that I had attained the very <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">pinnacle of the castle</span>, I commenced to rush up the few steps beyond the door; but 
        the sudden <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">veiling of the moon</span> by a cloud caused me to <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">stumble</span>, and I felt my way more slowly in the dark. It was still very dark 
        when I reached the gratingâ€”which I tried carefully and found unlocked, but which I did not open for <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">fear of falling</span> from the amazing 
        height to which I had climbed. <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">Then the moon came out</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most demoniacal of all shocks is that of the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">abysmally unexpected</span> and <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">grotesquely unbelievable</span>. Nothing I had before undergone could 
        compare in terror with what I now saw; with <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">the bizarre marvels that sight implied</span>. The sight itself was as simple as it was stupefying, 
        for it was merely this: instead of a dizzying prospect of treetops seen from a lofty eminence, there stretched around me on the level 
        through the grating nothing less than the solid ground, decked and diversified <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">by marble slabs and columns</span>, and overshadowed by an <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">ancient 
        stone church</span>, whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">moonlight</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Half unconscious, I opened the grating and staggered out upon the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">white gravel</span> path that <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">stretched away in two directions</span>. My mind, 
        stunned and chaotic as it was, still held <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">the frantic <a href="page3.html">craving for light</a></span>; and not even the fantastic wonder which had happened 
        could stay my course. I neither knew nor cared whether my experience was <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">insanity, dreaming, or magic</span>; but was determined to gaze on 
        brilliance and gaiety <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">at any cost</span>. I knew not who I was or what I was, or what my surroundings might be; though as I continued to stumble 
        along I became conscious of a kind of <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">fearsome latent memory</span> that made my progress not wholly fortuitous. I passed under an arch out of 
        that region of slabs and columns, and wandered through the open country; sometimes following the visible road, but sometimes leaving it 
        curiously to <a href="page5.html">tread across meadows</a> where only occasional ruins bespoke the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">ancient presence of a forgotten road</span>. Once I swam 
        across a swift river where <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">crumbling, mossy masonry</span> told of a bridge long <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">vanished</span>.

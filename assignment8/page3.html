    <p>
        From such books I learned all that I know. No teacher urged or guided me, and I 
        <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">do not recall hearing</span> any human voice in all those yearsâ€”<span id="shaky" class="shakeText">not even my own</span>; for although
        I had read of speech, I had never thought to try to speak aloud. My aspect was a matter 
        <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">equally unthought of</span>, for there were <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">no mirrors</span> in the castle, and I merely regarded myself 
        by instinct as akin to the youthful figures I saw drawn and painted in the books. I felt conscious 
        of youth because I <span id="shaky" class="shakeText"><a href="page2.html">remembered so little</a></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside, across the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">putrid moat</span> and under <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">the dark mute trees</span>, I would often lie and dream for hours 
        about what I read in the books; and would <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">longingly picture myself</span> amidst gay crowds in the sunny <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">world 
        <a href="page4.html">beyond the endless forests</a></span>. Once I <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">tried to escape</span> from the forest, but as I went farther from
        the castle the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">shade grew denser</span> and the air more <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">filled with brooding fear</span>; so that I ran frantically back 
        lest I lose my way in a labyrinth of <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">nighted silence</span>.

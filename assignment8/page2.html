        I know not where I was born, save that the castle was <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">infinitely old and infinitely horrible</span>, 
        full of <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">dark passages and having high ceilings</span> where the eye could find only <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">cobwebs and shadows</span>. 
        The stones in the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">crumbling corridors</span> seemed always hideously damp, and there was an <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">accursed smell</span> 
        everywhere, as of the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">piled-up corpses of dead generations</span>. It was never light, so that I used sometimes 
        to light candles and gaze steadily at them for relief, nor was there any sun outdoors, since the terrible 
        trees grew high above the topmost accessible tower. There was one <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">black tower</span> which reached above the trees 
        into the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">unknown outer sky</span>, but that was partly ruined and could not be ascended save by a <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">well-nigh <a href="page4.html">impossible climb</a></span> 
        up the sheer wall, stone by stone.
    </p>
    <p>
        I must have lived years in this place, but I <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">cannot measure the time</span>. Beings must have cared for my needs, yet I cannot recall 
        any person except myself, or anything alive but the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">noiseless rats and bats and spiders</span>. I think that whoever nursed me must have 
        been shockingly aged, since my first conception of a living person was that of somebody <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">mockingly like myself</span>, yet <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">distorted, 
        shrivelled, and decaying</span> like the castle. To me there was nothing grotesque in the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">bones and skeletons</span> that strewed some of the 
        stone crypts <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">deep down</span> among the foundations. I fantastically associated these things with everyday events, and thought them more 
        natural than the <span id="shaky" class="shakeText">coloured pictures of living beings</span> which I found in many of the <a href="page3.html">mouldy books</a>.
